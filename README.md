I developed this app with a focus on mastering the [Core ML](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml) and [Create ML](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/createml) APIs.

The app presents challenging math questions, requiring users to provide their answers to assess their sobriety.
To achieve this, I harnessed Apple's MNIST model, which recognizes handwritten digits.
Moreover, I integrated PencilKit to offer users a canvas for drawing their responses.

During my learning process, debugging the ML model posed a significant challenge.
Initially, the model's accuracy was subpar.
To improve it, I addressed two pivotal issues: a) modifying the input format to white on black and b) increasing the marker width on the canvas.
